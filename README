Graphline is a library for processing data using acyclic graphs of connected,
independent functions.  Initially, it is being writen to take the place of
JACK for a single-application case, but it should have other uses as well.

Requirements
------------
Graphline requires atomickit. At the moment both should be the latest git.

Installation
------------
Link config.def.mk to config.mk, or copy config.def.mk to config.mk and edit
to match your local setup (this is installed under /usr/local by default).
Then enter the following commands:

	make
	sudo make install
